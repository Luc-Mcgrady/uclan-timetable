This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

How uni managed to make the loading times like a second I do not know.

The main page of this site is [/timetable](http://uclan.lucmcgrady.com/timetable). 
If you feel you can do a better job at portraying the timetable use /api/timetable

It takes a basic authentication header and a body in the format
```json
{
  email: string,
  date: "YY-MM-DD"
}
```

Alternatively you can just copy all my code because you have it.
